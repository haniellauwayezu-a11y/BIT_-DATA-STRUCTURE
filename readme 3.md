 Project 115: Stack and Queue Questions

This project demonstrates the implementation and application of **Stack** and **Queue** data structures using Python. Each task reflects real-world scenarios in Rwanda, such as MoMo transactions, university assessments, and service queues in public institutions. The project includes practical examples, challenge problems, and reflection questions to deepen understanding.

# Stack Tasks

###  Practical 1: MoMo Push/Undo

- **Action**: Push `["PIN", "Amount", "Confirm"]` onto the stack.
- **Undo**: One pop operation.
- **Result**: Stack contains `['PIN', 'Amount']`.

---

###  Practical 2: UR Quiz Stack

- **Action**: Push `["Quiz1", "Quiz2", "Quiz3"]`, then pop two.
- **Result**: Top of the stack is `"Quiz1"`.

---

##  Queue Tasks

###  Practical 1: RRA Citizens Queue

- **Scenario**: 8 citizens are queued.
- **After**: 2 are served (popped).
- **Next**: `Citizen3` is next in line.

---

###  Practical 2: BK ATM Queue

- **Scenario**: 10 clients queue up.
- **Question**: Who is second?
- **Answer**: `Client2`.

---

##  Challenge Solutions

###  Stack Challenge: Reverse "QUEUESTACK"

- **Approach**: Use a stack to reverse characters.
- **Reversed Output**: `"KCATSEUUEQ"`

###  Stack vs Queue in Hospitals

| Structure | Behavior | Fairness | Recommended for Hospitals? |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------------------|
| Stack     | LIFO     |  Unfair |  No                       |
| Queue     | FIFO     |  Fair  |  Yes                      |

- **Conclusion**: Queue is fair and suitable for real-life services like hospitals.
