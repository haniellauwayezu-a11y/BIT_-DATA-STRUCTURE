Project 115: Market Basket Analyzer

This project demonstrates fundamental Python operations in the context of a retail market basket analysis system. It includes data handling with integers, strings, booleans, lists, arrays, and dictionaries.

 Integers
- Calculates total, average, min, and max of item purchase counts.

 Strings
- Generates a formatted summary report using f-strings.

 Booleans
- Evaluates if average purchases exceed a threshold using compound conditions.

 Lists
- Maintains item records with add/remove/sort operations.

 Arrays
- Uses Python's `array` module for efficient storage and comparison with lists.

 Dictionaries
- Manages item data with IDs, names, and values.
- Supports update, delete, and value summarization.
